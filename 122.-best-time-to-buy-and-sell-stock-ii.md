# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
</strong><strong>Output: 7
</strong><strong>Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
</strong>Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
</strong>Total profit is 4.
</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong><strong>Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
* `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

#### Problem Explanation

In this problem, you are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day. You can complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) but you cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (you must sell the stock before buying again). Your objective is to maximize your profit.

#### Solution Approach

We will iterate through the `prices` array and capture the profit from every consecutive day where the price increases. This way, we sum up the gains from all local increases without worrying about the exact buy and sell days.

#### Swift Code Implementation

swift

```swift
func maxProfit(_ prices: [Int]) -> Int {
    var maxProfit = 0
    
    for i in 1..<prices.count {
        if prices[i] > prices[i - 1] {
            maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        }
    }
    
    return maxProfit
}
```

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable `maxProfit` initialized to 0, which will keep track of the accumulated profit.
2. **Iteration**: Loop through the `prices` array starting from the second element.
3. **Profit Calculation**: For each day, if the current day's price is higher than the previous day's price, calculate the profit for that day by subtracting the previous day's price from the current day's price and add this profit to `maxProfit`.
4. **Return Result**: After iterating through the array, return the accumulated `maxProfit`.

#### Time Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `prices` array. This is because we only iterate through the array once.

#### Space Complexity

* **Space Complexity**: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

#### Summary Bullet Points

* **Initialization**: Start with `maxProfit` set to 0.
* **Iterate through Prices**: Loop through the `prices` array from the second element.
* **Accumulate Profit**: Add to `maxProfit` whenever the current day's price is higher than the previous day's price.
* **Return**: Return the accumulated `maxProfit`.
