# 64. Minimum Path Sum

#### Problem Explanation

You are given an `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, and your task is to find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner that minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

#### Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to build a DP table where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`.

#### Swift Code Implementation

swift

```swift
class Solution {
    func minPathSum(_ grid: [[Int]]) -> Int {
        let m = grid.count
        let n = grid[0].count
        var dp = grid
        
        // Initialize the first row
        for j in 1..<n {
            dp[0][j] += dp[0][j - 1]
        }
        
        // Initialize the first column
        for i in 1..<m {
            dp[i][0] += dp[i - 1][0]
        }
        
        // Fill in the rest of the DP table
        for i in 1..<m {
            for j in 1..<n {
                dp[i][j] += min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
    }
}
```

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   * Create a DP table `dp` initialized with the values from the input `grid`.
   * Get the dimensions of the grid: `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns).
2. **Initialize the First Row**:

```
for j in 1..<n {
    dp[0][j] += dp[0][j - 1]
}
```

* Update each cell in the first row by accumulating the sum from the left.
* For each cell in the first row (starting from the second cell), add the value of the cell to the left to it. This accumulates the path sums across the first row.

3. **Initialize the First Column**:

```
for i in 1..<m {
    dp[i][0] += dp[i - 1][0]
}
```

* Update each cell in the first column by accumulating the sum from above.
* For each cell in the first column (starting from the second cell), add the value of the cell above to it. This accumulates the path sums down the first column.

4. **Fill in the Rest of the DP Table**:

```
for i in 1..<m {
    for j in 1..<n {
        dp[i][j] += min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    }
}
```

* For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the minimum path sum by taking the minimum of the values from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`, and add the current cell's value `grid[i][j]`.
* For each cell not in the first row or first column, add the minimum value from the cell above or to the left to the current cell. This keeps track of the minimum path sum to reach each cell.

5. **Return the Result**:

```
return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```

* The bottom-right cell `dp[m - 1][n - 1]` contains the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

#### Debug Table

| Step                | DP Table State                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Initial             | \[\[1, 3, 1], \[1, 5, 1], \[4, 2, 1]] |
| First Row           | \[\[1, 4, 5], \[1, 5, 1], \[4, 2, 1]] |
| First Column        | \[\[1, 4, 5], \[2, 5, 1], \[6, 2, 1]] |
| Rest of Table (1,1) | \[\[1, 4, 5], \[2, 7, 1], \[6, 2, 1]] |
| Rest of Table (1,2) | \[\[1, 4, 5], \[2, 7, 6], \[6, 2, 1]] |
| Rest of Table (2,1) | \[\[1, 4, 5], \[2, 7, 6], \[6, 8, 1]] |
| Rest of Table (2,2) | \[\[1, 4, 5], \[2, 7, 6], \[6, 8, 7]] |

#### Summary Bullet Points

* Start with the given grid and copy it to a table (`dp`).
* Fill the first row and column with cumulative sums.
* For the rest of the cells, choose the minimum path sum from either the cell above or the cell to the left.
* The bottom-right cell of the table holds the minimum path sum.

#### Time Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: O(m×n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We iterate through each cell exactly once.

#### Space Complexity

* **Space Complexity**: O(1), if we consider modifying the input `grid` in place. Otherwise, it's O(m×n) for the additional `dp` table.

#### Summary Bullet Points

* **Initialization**: Create a DP table initialized with the input grid values.
* **First Row and Column**: Update the first row and column to accumulate path sums.
* **Fill DP Table**: Update each cell with the minimum path sum from the top-left corner.
* **Return Result**: Return the bottom-right cell value which contains the minimum path sum.

This approach ensures an efficient computation of the minimum path sum using dynamic programming.
